# TaraNix

TaraNix is an ambitious exploration of an alternative userspace and system design using the Linux Kernel as a base.

The goal of this project is a modern, secure-by-design foundation for a Linux OS, built from the ground up, taking advantage of all the lessons learned and failures had over the past decades.

Project development repositories are currently private.
